### Setting it up
🔧 Here are a few steps on how to set this extension up:

1. Make sure you have enabled developer mode in Chrome at `chrome://extensions`
2. Clone this repo, and press 'Load unpacked' from `chrome://extensions` to load this extension 
3. Go to `key.js` and replace the field of your own `APP_KEY`. It can found out at https://trello.com/app-key
4. Add the Chrome extension ID to Allowed origins section in the same Trello page (e.g. `chrome-extension://okpdemdmpglaapjpbdphmfhlfjbilbpc`)

That's it! You should be able to use the extension and see your cards on Trello.<br />
<b>Don't forget</b> to add the ID in app-key page, or you will receive an `invalid_redirect` error during authorization.
